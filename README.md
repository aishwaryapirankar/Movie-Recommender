# Movie Recommender System

This repository contains code for a movie recommender system implemented using Item-based Collaborative Filtering. The system suggests movies to users based on their past viewing history.

## Introduction

Recommender systems are widely used in various online platforms such as Netflix, Spotify, and Amazon to personalize user experiences by suggesting items that are likely to be of interest to them. Collaborative Filtering is one of the most common techniques used in building recommender systems.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the MovieLens 100K dataset, which contains ratings provided by users for various movies. You can download the dataset from the following link:

## Implementation

The movie recommender system is implemented in Python, and the main technique used is Item-based Collaborative Filtering. This technique recommends items based on the similarity between items, rather than similarity between users. 

The steps involved in the implementation include:

1. Loading the dataset
2. Preprocessing the data
3. Calculating item-item similarity
4. Generating recommendations for users
